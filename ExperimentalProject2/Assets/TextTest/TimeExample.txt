Try to imagine a life without timekeeping.[pause=0.5] You probably can’t.
You know the month,[pause=0.3] the year, [pause=0.3]the day of the week.
There is a clock on your wall or the dashboard of your car.
You have a schedule,[pause=0.3] a calendar, [pause=0.3]a time for dinner or a movie.
Yet all around you,[pause=0.3] timekeeping is ignored.
Birds are not late.
A dog does not check its watch.
Deer do not fret over passing birthdays.
Man alone measures time.
Man alone chimes the hour.
And, because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear that no other creature endures.[pause=0.8]
A fear of time[pause=1] running out.
<i>― Mitch Albom,[pause=1] The Time Keeper</i>
